Hello and Welcome to our Assessment.

Please find an eclipse project with some code-stubs which you
need to fill out. 

The task is to crawl and store as many URLs as possible from
our list of URLs (i.e. emphasis on scalability).

Before starting your assessment, please FORK this repo on your
github account. 

You can find the code in the "src" folder

and you can find the URL data to crawl in "resources"

Good luck and Enjoy

-----------------------------------------------------
Extra task, implement TF-IDF[1] on a sample of URLs from your
KeyValue Store.
